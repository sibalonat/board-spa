Project with Kanban, with columns and cards. 
Most of the code is just in one Component. Choice for develivery and making more room for things i wanted to do on Sunday. 

The project out to have all the crud for column and for cards. For cards the only one missing, is delete, but has one addition that is the ability to change the column id which is the parent relation in the query. 

It uses VUE 2 (BLAW), so no composition API and some very weird plugins. But i think they do the job. 

Such plugins are out to be mentioned though. Is the Vue Modal and Vue Draggable

For the column create there is a html that gets added to the dom every time one condition is true through computed - they shine in these type of scenarios. 

Ive used SASS or SCSS for this project. Due to how long have i been using Tailwind the first impression after some time, SASS seemed quite useless. But i believe that scoping and some other addition of varible inheritance get the job done pretty well. I started by criziting the library to actually after finishing thinking that css, is to premature. So it maybe how you learn.
